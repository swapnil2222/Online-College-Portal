Today everyone is connected with each other using social networking sites, but in collegeâ€™s student have to face problem when there is need to communicate with college faculty such as Head of Department, professor and other staff such as librarian, clerk of particular section (Academic, examination or scholarship section) of institute, but due to unavailability of staff at that moment student have to meet them later which results in inconvenience of student.
In order to resolve this problem, we are going to develop an application which is mobile and web based where student can directly make contact with the respective person of a department depending upon their official status (either available, busy or away from desktop). Student will be able to see their official information like name, designation, photo and status. Based on status, student will be able to send a message related to their problem to respective stakeholder (staff, clerk or librarian) which will be received as notification on their desktop or mobile. 
Primary Features:
-	Official Information of all the stakeholders (staff and clerks )of a college.
-	Instant Messaging feature. (Including status like delivered, read etc.)
-	Mobile as well as Web Notifications of incoming messages.
-	Centralized database will be accessed by web as well as mobile application.
Future Scope:
-	Students will be able to make chat with another students. (Restricted up to college level)
-	Faculty can share files which will be accessed by all students.
